# INFX512 Spring 2018 Coursework

Welcome to INFX Beginning Web Development! This is an entirely online course that will teach you the basics of client-side web development. This is a true beginner's course: it assumes no prior programming experience, and the difficulty level is set for those who have never done any kind of programming before.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
